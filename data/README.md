# Data for the EDA Activity

This is the [zip data](https://github.com/Lingesh2311/GraduateLearningPlan/blob/main/data/vehicle_loans_clean.csv.zip) for performing the data. This is the clean dataset with (40 + 1) columns and ~ 233k rows. 

It describes the features of a banker who is lending vehicle loans and `loan_default` column depicts whether the customer had defaulted the loan on their first EMI or not.

The [data dictionary](https://github.com/Lingesh2311/GraduateLearningPlan/blob/main/data/data_dictionary.csv) elaborates the meaning of each column - this can help with your EDA task.
